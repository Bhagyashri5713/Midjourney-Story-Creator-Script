Eva and Renee had never been very close. In fact, they couldn't have been farther apart. Eva had always been the straight A student, the overachiever. She had left home as soon as she graduated and quickly become one of the most successful criminal law attorneys in the city. Renee, on the other hand, had spent years struggling to keep up with Eva. With no degree and not much else to offer, she had become an artist, eking out a living by selling her work in the shady part of downtown.

Everything changed when a string of robberies and art thefts began to plague the city. When the headlines claimed that a mysterious artist was behind the crimes, no one could have guessed the truth: Renee was the artist in question.

Eva was livid. When the police came knocking on Renee's door and subsequently arrested her, Eva knew she had to take action. She got on the phone and started making calls, gathering what evidence she could to prove Renee's innocence.

Days passed and each morning brought more bad news. Finally, Eva had an idea. She hatched a plan to set a trap for the real culprit. Working off of her sister's clues, Eva and Renee set off on a wild goose chase. They followed up on leads, meeting with old acquaintances, searching for evidence. 

Finally, on the brink of giving up, Eva uncovered the truth about the real criminal. With the help of Renee's artistic talent and their combined investigations, Eva was able to prove her sister's innocence.

With a wave of relief, Renee was exonerated and her reputation restored. From then on, they were much closer than they ever had been before. Eva and Renee looked back at their ordeal as an adventure and forged a bond that would never break.
